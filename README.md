Hi, I’m Maximilian Ponomarev — a Mathematics student at TUM with a strong 
interest in quantitative methods, data analysis, and applied problem-solving.

On this GitHub you’ll find a selection of small analytical projects, 
prototypes, and algorithmic experiments from my studies and personal work. 
I enjoy working with structured data, exploring patterns, and building 
clean, reproducible workflows.

Currently, I’m gaining experience in areas ranging from statistical 
modelling to practical software tools used in quantitative and 
actuarial contexts.
